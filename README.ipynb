    "Hidden Gem is a listing site dedicated to small business Bed and Breakfasts. In addition to a listing site that caters to Bed & Breakfast patrons' nuances, Hidden Gem contains a catalog of unique attractions that local business owners have entered.  These attractions can range from local hikes, waterfalls, magical antique stores, excellent restaurants, and such like; these attractions are the Hidden Gems.  The majority of the Gems are not viewable from the website and show up as blurred images.  Once the guest books the Bed & Breakfast, all of the local Gems related that Bed & Breakfast can be viewed.   The local Gems allow the guest to immerse themselves within a new environment from a local perspective. "
